Filters:
    Right now you have to hack the filters manually in '<home>/.yamm/.filters'
    The file can look like this:

      subject;contains;test;test-files;testing

    'subject' means that it is the subject that should be checked. 
    It can also be 'from', 'to' or 'reply'.
    'contains' is the condition. It can also be 'is'.
    'test' is the argument. It can be whatever you want.
    'test-files' is the box. It can be whatever you want.
    'testing' is the name of this filter. It can be whatever you want.

    In other words this means:

      If the subject contains test, then move to the box test-files.
