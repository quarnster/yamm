Please make sure you have jre or jdk 1.2 installed.
If you do not have one of these, goto http://java.sun.com:80/products/jdk/1.2

Once you have the jdk (or jre) up and running untar the file with for example:

'tar xvfz yamm-<version>.tar.gz'

Windows users can untar it with winzip (http://www.winzip.com).
Then change directory to 'yamm-<version>' and type:

'java -jar yamm.jar'

to run it or change directory to 'yamm-<version>/source' and type:

'make'

to rebuild it. (Rebuilding requires jdk and make)


Have fun!
