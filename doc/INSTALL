Please make sure you have jre or jdk 1.4 installed.
If you do not have one of these, goto http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/

Once you have the jdk (or jre) up and running untar the file with for example:

'tar xvfz yamm-<version>.tar.gz'

Windows users can untar it with winzip (http://www.winzip.com).
Then change directory to 'yamm-<version>' and type:

$ java -jar yamm.jar

Windows users can simply double click yamm.jar to start the program.



If you wish to rebuild the sourcecode 
change directory to 'yamm-<version>/source' and type:

$ make jar

(Rebuilding requires jdk and make)


Have fun!
