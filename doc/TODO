From Pablo Rodriguez

-a draft folder in which messages can be saved while they're being composed 
(right now the options are to send a message or to erase it after composing).

-different smtp servers (I guess it would be useful to link identities with 
pop3 and smtp servers).

-authentication with login and password (the same as pop3) on smtp servers.
